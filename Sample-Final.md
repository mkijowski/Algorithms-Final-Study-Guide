Consider four graph algorithms with the following worst case running
times (where *n* is the size of the node set and *m* is the size of the edge set):
`n lg n`, `n lg m`, `m lg n`, and `m lg m`. Using the big-Oh criteria, determine
which ones are equivalent, and on that basis, order the equivalence classes.
